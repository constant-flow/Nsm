# Nsm - NDI Simple Monitor

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/k1aF4J0l.jpg)

**Nsm** is a small utility app that receives an [NDI] video stream and displays
it with a full-screen view.

[ndi]: https://www.newtek.com/ndi/

I developed this app simply because NewTek doesn't provide NDI Monitor software
for some platforms (Linux and mobiles).

## System requirements

Nsm runs on the following systems:

- x86-64 based Linux system with Vulkan support
- arm64 Android devices with Vulkan support
- 64-bit iOS devices with Metal support

## Installation

Pre-built Linux binaries are available on the [Releases] page.

[releases]: https://github.com/keijiro/Nsm/releases

For other platforms (Android/iOS), there is no pre-built app. You have to
install Unity and manually build the project.

## How to use

- Select a NDI source from the drop-down menu.
- You can hide the drop-down menu by clicking an empty space of the screen.
  Click again to make the menu reappear.

## Advanced Usage

- Select a NDI source via commandline argument `-ndiChannel "<Name of Channel in List>"` to automate startup
- if the channel is found it hides also the dropdown
